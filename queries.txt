#Some tentative, templatey, potential queries
#For the Sabbath-Scheduler project.


#insert location

INSERT INTO Location(Name, Address)
VALUES ("$name", "$address");


#insert people

INSERT INTO Person(First_Name, Last_Name, email, password)
VALUES ("$FirstName", "$LastName", "$email", "$password");


#insert event

INSERT INTO Event(Name, Date, Time, loc_id)
VALUES ("$name", "$date", "$time", "$loc_id");

loc_id is selected in the drop down. It is associated with the string value the user selects in the button.


#view calendar

SELECT * FROM Event
WHERE <condition>;

condition is determined at runtime. The filter might work by adding conditions end on end. For example, I might use:

"WHERE loc_id == ($loc_from_DropDown) AND 
event_id IN (SELECT event_id FROM Event_Role
WHERE event_role_id IN (
SELECT event_role_id FROM People_In_Role
WHERE person_id == "$person_from_DropDown"))


#View Event

SELECT (First_Name, Last_Name, email) FROM Person
WHERE person_id IN (SELECT person_id FROM People_In_Role WHERE event_role_id IN (SELECT event_role_id FROM Event_Role WHERE event_id == "$event_id"));

#If the person is an admin of the location where an event takes place, he or she should be able to edit it as well.

#To check if someone is an administrator for this event
SELECT * FROM Admin
WHERE person_id == "$user_id" AND 
loc_id IN (SELECT loc_id FROM Event
WHERE event_id == "$event_id");

#Once we've determined they are, they can edit the event.
SELECT * FROM Person
WHERE person_id IN (SELECT person_id FROM People_In_Role
WHERE event_role_id IN (SELECT event_role_id FROM Event_Role
WHERE event_id == "$event_id"));

UPDATE People_In_Role 
SET person_id = "$newPerson"
WHERE person_id == "$oldPerson" AND event_role_id IN (SELECT event_role_id FROM Event_Role
WHERE event_id == "$event_id");


#User Log in
#The first one gets you the user ID for this user, and
#The second one gets you any locations he or she is an 
#administrator for.

SELECT person_id FROM Person
WHERE email == "$email" AND password == "$password";

SELECT loc_id FROM Admin 
WHERE person_id == "$person_id"
